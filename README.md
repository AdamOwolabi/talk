## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Audio Processing
The application supports various audio formats. For production use, consider:
- Implementing proper audio compression
- Adding audio format validation
- Setting up cloud storage for audio files

## How It Works

### 1. Question Selection
Users choose from a curated list of open-ended questions about their daily life, work, hobbies, or goals.

### 2. Speech Recording
- 90-second recording session with real-time visual feedback
- Automatic speech-to-text conversion
- Audio quality monitoring

### 3. Analysis Process
The system analyzes multiple aspects:

**Speech Analysis:**
- Filler word detection and counting
- Vocabulary diversity assessment
- Sentence structure analysis
- Speech rate calculation
- Clarity and precision evaluation

**TOEFL Assessment:**
- Fluency scoring (25% weight)
- Pronunciation evaluation (20% weight)
- Vocabulary assessment (20% weight)
- Grammar analysis (20% weight)
- Coherence scoring (15% weight)

### 4. Improvement Plan Generation
Based on analysis results, the system creates:
- Priority areas for improvement
- Daily, weekly, and monthly exercises
- Recommended resources and tools
- Timeline and milestones
- Motivation tips

## UI/UX Features

### Modern Design
- Clean, minimalist interface
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for all devices
- Accessibility considerations

### Interactive Elements
- Real-time recording visualization
- Progress indicators
- Animated score displays
- Interactive improvement plans

## Analysis Metrics

### Speech Rate
- Optimal: 120-180 words per minute
- Too slow: < 100 WPM
- Too fast: > 200 WPM

### Filler Words
- Excellent: < 2% of total words
- Good: 2-5%
- Needs improvement: > 5%

### Vocabulary Diversity
- Measured by unique words ratio
- Target: > 60% diversity
- Considers vague and weak word usage

### Grammar Accuracy
- Subject-verb agreement
- Article usage
- Tense consistency
- Sentence structure

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox and Grid
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Interactive functionality
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server runtime
- **Express.js**: Web framework
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Natural**: Natural language processing
- **Compromise**: Text analysis

### Audio Processing
- **Web Audio API**: Browser-based audio capture
- **MediaRecorder API**: Audio recording
- **WAV format**: Audio file handling

## Security Considerations

- Audio files are stored locally (consider cloud storage for production)
- No sensitive data is transmitted without encryption
- Input validation on all user inputs
- CORS configuration for API endpoints

## Deployment

### Heroku
```bash
heroku create your-talk-app
git push heroku main
```

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t talk-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 talk-app
```

### Vercel/Netlify
Configure for Node.js applications with proper build settings.
